      <p>To ensure that we meet our goal to save dogâ€™s lives, or improve upon their living conditions, we liaison with kill and non-kill shelters, pounds, other rescues, owners, and whomever else we can. We believe that with these combined efforts we can cut down on the number of animals that are euthanized needlessly each year.</p><br>
      <p>Within the comforts of our approved foster homes, we then provide the necessary medical attention, rehabilitation, emotional support, and re-training for all rescued dogs that come into our care. Only then, through careful screening, do we find loving forever homes for these dogs.</p>
