LOYAL Rescue Inc. a private, registered, non-profit, foster-based dog rescue with foster home across Ontario. We will help any dog in need that we can, regardless of breed, age, medical condition or place of birth.

Our mission is to find homes for dogs that find themselves homeless, either through abuse, neglect, abandonment, or being born in a puppy mill.  We feel a responsibility towards these unfortunate animals, and work to find new permanent, loving, forever families for them.
